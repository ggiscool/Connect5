# Connect5
## Connect 4, but BETTER.
### Overview
  Connect 5 is exactly like Connect 4, except that the board is one spot longer in each direction. Red and Blue players alternate placing pieces on the board, with the goal of getting 5 pieces in a row either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. In this version, Red goes first upon the start of each new game, and alternates turns with Blue.



## How to Play
  1. Click anywhere on the column in which you wish to drop your piece.
  1. Take turns with another player who does the same.
  1. Alternate taking turns until someone acheives 5-in-a-row!
  
### Technical Difficulties
  I had quite a few technical difficulties while building this game, as I am just learning and getting comfortable with coding. I got held up for days on different portions of the win scenarios functions, which put me behind a bit. I also was trying to do some more with CSS, such as change the background color of the page when a win or stalemate was reached, and make the win statements have a gradient flow effect on them. I spent hour trying to get the stalemate scenario to work correctly, to no avail.

### Future Implementations
  Due to a few hold-ups mentioned in the "Technical DIfficulties" section, I could not do as much work on the CSS as I had wanted. In the future, I would like to add a theme, add multiple rounds with different randomized themes, add a scorecard for the rounds, add places to enter player names, and dry up my win scenarios code.

### Tech Used
  -HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
  -Atom for text-editing.
  
### Credits

### Acknowledgments
  Thank you to all my classmates and TAs who helped me get through this project and create a functioning, playable game. Special thanks to Vernon, Tyler, and my video crew, Sean and Hector.
